The encoded peak representations, embedded precursor information, and the previouly predicted amino acids in the peptide (P, E, P), are fed into the transformer decoder to predict the next amino acid. Linear and Softmax layers are used once again for each peak, this time to determine if the peaks match a b or y ion for the current peptide."
