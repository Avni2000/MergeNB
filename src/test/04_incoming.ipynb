    "Cascadia builds off of Casanovo’s core architecture, predicting one amino acid at a time using a Transformer decoder. But, instead of relying on a single encoded MS2 spectrum, Cascadia incorporates multiple sources of spectral evidence (the augmented spectra), allowing it to decode a richer representation. The encoded peak representations, embedded precursor information, and the previouly predicted amino acids in the peptide (P, E, P), are fed into the transformer decoder to predict the next amino acid. Linear and Softmax layers are used once again for each peak, this time to determine if the peaks match a b or y ion for the current peptide."
